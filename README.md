# Clicky-Game: NBA Edition

## `Summary`
'clicky-game: NBA Edition' is an application, built upon React, would test upon the user's memory based on clicking a different card of an NBA player. There are 16 total NBA Player cards drawn on the board for this game. After the user click on any of the 16 cards of NBA players, it will be reshuffled automatically and the user must select a different card from what they previously chose. If the user selects a different card from the selected, the scoreboard will update and give them 1 point. The maximum amount of points the user can get is 16. If the user selects a NBA Player card that they had already selected, the game will reset the score back to 0.
